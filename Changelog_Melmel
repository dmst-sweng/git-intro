Cloned the master repo
$ git clone https://github.com/dmst-sweng/git-intro.git

Created branch to work on
$ git branch add-substory

Switched to branch 'add-substory'
$ git checkout add-substory

After adding the changed ExcitingStory.java file to my directory I typed git status
$ git status
On branch add-substory
Changes not staged for commit:
        modified:   src/main/java/ExcitingStory.java
no changes added to commit

I staged the file
$ git add src/main/java/ExcitingStory.java

I moved the file to history
$ git commit -m "Added a cooking adventure sub-story."
[add-substory 3216e7d] Added a cooking adventure sub-story.
 1 file changed, 58 insertions(+), 4 deletions(-)

I finally pushed the new branch to be glued to the master 
$ git push -u origin add-substory


When I tried to 
git chekout master
git pull
git merge add-substory

the origin/master and my add-substory branch had so many conflicts that resulted in many failed attempts to 
merge master and add-substory branch locally

In the end what I did was:

$ git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'

(master)
$ git pull
Already up-to-date.

(master)
$ git checkout add-substory
Switched to branch 'add-substory'
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/add-substory'.

I then added my part to the java file and typed git status, to see the modified file:

(add-substory)
$ git status
On branch add-substory
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/add-substory'.
